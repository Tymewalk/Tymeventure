# Tymeventure
A small adventure game I'm working on. Currently it's nothing big, but it will be. Eventually.

## How to install
You will need:
 - Python 3.4
 - Curses for Python 3.4

Download the .zip of the game. In the future you really should go to the Releases tab, but there's not much here right now so you can go ahead and just download the latest commit.

Exctract it into a folder. Enter that folder, then run `python setup.py build`.
After that, run `python setup.py install`.
Run `tymeventure` to play the game.

## I have an old version installed. Do I need to uninstall it to update?
No, you don't. Just re-run the setup instructions and it'll work fine.

## Uh, there's a problem!
Simply report an issue and I'll get to it.

## There was a problem but I fixed it now!
Make a pull request and I'll check it over. If it's good (as in it doesn't introduce more bugs or go against the goal of the project), then I'll add it in.

## I have an idea!
Suggest ideas on [the Scratch topic](https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/185267/).
Alternatively, you can make a pull request and add your idea to IDEAS.md.
