# Tymeventure
A small adventure game I'm working on. Make a pull request if you want to change something.

## How to install
You will need:
 - Python 3.4
 - Curses for Python 3.4

Download the .zip of the game. Then extract it into a folder. Enter that folder, then:

 - On Windows: Double-click tymeventure.py to launch it
 - On Linux: Use "python3.4 tymeventure.py"
