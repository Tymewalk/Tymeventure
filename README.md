# Tymeventure
A small adventure game I'm working on. Make a pull request if you want to change something.

## How to install
You will need:
 - Python 3.4
 - Curses for Python 3.4

Download the .zip of the game. In the future you really should go to the Releases tab, but there's not much here right now so you can go ahead and just download the latest commit.

Exctract it into a folder. Enter that folder, then:

 - On Windows: Double-click tymeventure.py to launch it
 - On Linux: Use "python3.4 tymeventure.py"
