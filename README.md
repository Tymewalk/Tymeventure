# Tymeventure
A small adventure game I'm working on. Currently it's nothing big, but it will be. Eventually.

## How to install
You will need:
 - Python 3.4
 - Curses for Python 3.4

Download the .zip of the game. In the future you really should go to the Releases tab, but there's not much here right now so you can go ahead and just download the latest commit.

Exctract it into a folder. Enter that folder, then:

 - On Windows: Double-click tymeventure.py to launch it
 - On Linux: Use "python3.4 tymeventure.py"

## Uh, there's a problem!
Simply report an issue and I'll get to it.

## There was a problem but I fixed it now!
Make a pull request and I'll check it over. If it's good (as in it doesn't introduce more bugs or go against the goal of the project), then I'll add it in.

## I have an idea!
Make an issue that has a title starting with `[IDEA]`. I'll tag it as such so I don't get confused. When your idea is added/rejected (for whatever reason)/has to be closed, I'll mark it as closed.
